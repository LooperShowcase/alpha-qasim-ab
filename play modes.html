<h1>Normal Modes</h1>




  <h2>Showdown</h2>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQtKrAB3kyTJFOndcz5OvroXM3Nc_RTozyv8A&s" alt="">
<p>Showdown is one of the most popular and iconic modes in *Brawl Stars*. It's basically a Battle Royale mode where it's either every player for themselves (Solo Showdown) or in teams of two (Duo Showdown). The main goal? Be the last brawler or team standing.

### How it works:
- 10 players (Solo) or 5 teams (Duo) spawn on a large map.
- There's a poison gas (called "the storm") that slowly closes in, forcing players to fight in a smaller area.
- Power Cubes are scattered across the map in boxes or dropped by defeated enemies — collecting them makes your brawler stronger (more health + more damage).
- Last one or last team alive wins!

---

### Why it's fun:
- Fast-paced and intense.
- You can camp, go aggressive, or play smart.
- Power Cubes change the whole strategy — the more you have, the scarier you are.
- Good for pushing trophies solo without needing a full squad.

---

### Maps:
Showdown maps rotate daily, and each has different strategies:
- Some are bushy (perfect for ambush brawlers like Shelly or Bull).
- Others are open (good for snipers like Piper or Belle).
- Some maps have jump pads, teleporters, or healing mushrooms.

---

### Special Variations:
Sometimes Showdown has modifiers like:
- *Angry Robo* — a robot chases the nearest player.
- *Energy Drink* — makes you super strong temporarily.
- *Meteor Shower* — meteors randomly fall from the sky.

---

### Best Brawlers for Showdown (depending on the map):
- Tanks: Bull, Rosa, El Primo (bushy maps)
- Snipers: Piper, Brock, Belle (open maps)
- Survivors: Leon, Crow, Shelly (high burst or stealth)
- Throwers: Dynamike, Barley (map control near walls)

---

<h2>Brawl Ball</h2>
<img src="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.2327340144.6687/st,small,507x507-pad,600x600,f8f8f8.u1.jpg" alt="">
Brawl Ball is one of the most fun and competitive modes in *Brawl Stars*! It's basically *football (soccer)* but with Brawlers — mixed with chaos, supers, and explosions.

---

## How Brawl Ball Works:
- 3v3 mode.
- The goal is to score 2 goals before the other team.
- If it's a tie after 2 minutes → Overtime starts (walls break, no respawn delay).
- You can shoot the ball, pass it, or walk it into the goal.
- First team to score 2 goals wins (or whoever has more goals when time ends).

---

## Key Mechanics:
- While holding the ball, you *can't* use your main attack or super (only pass or shoot).
- Supers can destroy walls or even push the ball.
- You can use your Super to shoot the ball REALLY far or through enemies.
- Attacking players with the ball makes them drop it.

---

## Strategy Tips:
| Tip | Why It Works |
|-----|--------------|
| Control the middle | Mid control = more ball possession |
| Break walls | Open space makes scoring easier |
| Pass often | Quick passes confuse enemies |
| Don't rush alone | You’ll just feed enemy supers |
| Defend smart | Knock back, stun, or kill the ball carrier |

---

## Best Brawlers for Brawl Ball (Meta Picks):
### Tanks (Good for walking goals)
- El Primo
- Frank
- Jacky

### Aggressive / Goal Scorers
- Edgar
- Max
- Mortis (classic Brawl Ball legend)

### Support / Control
- Gene (pull)
- Tara (super sucks everyone)
- Sandy (invisibility team push)

### Wall Breakers
- Stu (super dash)
- Griff (super breaks walls)
- Brock (super for wall destruction)

---

## Overtime:
- All walls disappear.
- The map becomes very open.
- Long-range brawlers like Colt, Brock, or Bea become deadly here.

---

## Fun Fact:
Mortis is famous for being one of the most loved AND hated Brawl Ball brawlers. He's crazy good if the player knows how to dash around enemies and score sneaky goals... but if the player is bad? RIP the team.

<h2>Gem Grab</h2>
<img src="https://support.supercell.com/images/Vector-Smart-Object-6.png?v=1668780183" alt="">

Gem Grab is the *classic* mode of Brawl Stars — it's basically the original mode that the game launched with. It's a 3v3 mode all about collecting and holding gems that spawn in the center of the map.

---

## How Gem Grab Works:
- 3v3 teams.
- A gem spawns every few seconds in the middle from the gem mine.
- First team to collect *10 gems* and hold them for *15 seconds* wins.
- If a player carrying gems dies → all their gems drop on the ground.
- If neither team reaches 10 gems by the end of the match, the team with the most gems wins.

---

## Key Mechanics:
- Mid Control = Victory → Controlling the center area gives your team access to gems and control over the match.
- Gem Carrier → Usually 1 brawler is dedicated to collecting & holding gems (they stay safe while teammates protect them).
- Aggro Brawlers → Used to pressure the enemy and kill their gem carrier.
- Support/Control → Helps keep enemies back or heal teammates.

---

## Team Roles in Gem Grab:
| Role | Job | Example Brawlers |
|------|-----|------------------|
| Gem Carrier | Safely collects & holds gems | Pam, Poco, Jessie, Ruffs |
| Aggro | Pressures enemies, kills gem carrier | Mortis, Leon, Fang, Edgar |
| Control/Support | Zoning, wall-breaking, healing | Gene, Tara, Sandy, Sprout |

---

## Best Brawlers for Gem Grab:
### Gem Carriers
- Pam (healing + tanky)
- Poco (heals team)
- Byron (damage + heals)
- Ruffs (power-ups + control)

### Aggressive Killers
- Mortis (dash in & steal gems)
- Leon (invis sneak attacks)
- Edgar (jumps on gem carrier)
- Fang (super wipes teams)

### Control / Support
- Gene (pull gem carrier)
- Tara (super can flip a game)
- Sandy (invisibility team push)
- Sprout (traps enemies with walls)

---

## Pro Tips for Gem Grab:
- Don't rush the gem mine solo — teamwork is key.
- Protect your gem carrier at all costs.
- Don't hold too many gems on a risky brawler like Mortis.
- Use bushes & walls smartly for ambushes.
- If your team has 10 gems → Fall back and defend safely (don't be greedy).

---

## What Happens After 10 Gems?
→ *Countdown* starts (15 seconds timer).

- If your team survives for 15 seconds → Victory!
- If your gem carrier dies → Countdown cancels, collect the dropped gems to restart the countdown.

---

## Fun Fact:
- Gene's super (Magic Hand pull) is one of the deadliest moves in Gem Grab — he can pull the enemy gem carrier right into danger.

<h2>Knockout</h2>
<img src="https://support.supercell.com/images/icon_knockedout.png?v=1668780181" alt="">

Ouu nice pick! Knockout is one of the most *intense* and *strategic* modes in Brawl Stars — it's basically like *Search & Destroy* from Call of Duty or *Elimination Mode* — once you're dead, you're out for the round!

---

## How Knockout Works:
- 3v3 mode.
- No respawns during a round.
- First team to win *2 rounds* wins the match.
- Poison gas starts closing in after some time to prevent camping.
- If time runs out → team with more surviving players wins the round.

---

## Why It’s Different From Other Modes:
- Survival is key.
- You need to be careful but aggressive at the right moments.
- Teamwork & smart plays win over rushing blindly.
- Brawlers with range, burst damage, or utility are kings here.

---

## Best Brawlers for Knockout (Meta Picks)

### Long Range / Snipers
- Belle (amazing poke damage)
- Piper (1-shot potential)
- Mandy (super long range)
- Brock (great damage + wall breaker)

### Control / Support
- Ruffs (buff teammates)
- Sprout (zone control with walls)
- Gene (pull = free kill)
- Tara (super = game changer)

### Assassins / Ambush
- Leon (sneaky kills with invisibility)
- Crow (chip damage & slow)
- Fang (super wipes teams)
- Edgar (can work but risky)

---

## Knockout Maps:
Maps rotate often but usually have:
- Bushy sides (for sneaky plays)
- Open middles (sniper advantage)
- Walls for cover
- Small areas forcing fights in the poison gas

---

## Tips to Win in Knockout:
| Tip | Why It Works |
|-----|--------------|
| Play safe early | Don't feed supers early |
| Focus 1 target | 3v2 is much easier than 3v3 |
| Control bushes | Vision = survival |
| Save supers | Winning supers can carry rounds |
| Stay spread | Avoid getting wiped by 1 super |
| Watch the gas | Don't get trapped by poison |

---

## Fun Things That Happen in Knockout:
- 1v3 Clutch Moments → Nothing feels better than pulling off a 1v3 comeback.
- Poison Gas Endings → Force enemies into bad spots.
- Leon Sneak Kills → Suddenly... you're gone.

---

## Brawlers to Avoid (Most Maps):
- Tanks like El Primo or Bull (hard unless bushy map)
- Healers like Poco (less value here)
- Throwers like Barley (depends on map but easier to counter)

<h2>Wipeout</h2>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQpNGlrKWpKf8MAnFR2G5K-hL3RotQC8Cdo5KoeHdVdxXf97FQ6FsaAKFxL3RwVsl4Zw5s&usqp=CAU" alt="">

Ooo Wipeout Mode! That’s a super fun and underrated mode in Brawl Stars! It’s basically like *Team Deathmatch* — pure skill, pure chaos, no gems, no goals… just eliminations.

---

## How Wipeout Works:
- 3v3 mode.
- First team to get *8 kills* wins.
- If time runs out → team with the most kills wins.
- No respawn penalty → You respawn after a short time (unlike Knockout where you’re out for the round).
- The game is all about hunting kills and surviving.

---

## Why It's Different from Other Modes:
- No objectives → Just eliminations.
- Every kill matters.
- No need to protect gems or a ball → Only focus is defeating the enemy team.
- Super fast-paced.

---

## Best Brawlers for Wipeout (Meta Picks)

### Snipers & Long Range Kings
- Belle (perfect for poking damage)
- Piper (high burst damage)
- Mandy (huge range laser)
- Brock (control + wall breaker)

### High Damage / Control
- Spike (crazy damage & slows)
- Janet (versatile with gadget)
- Bea (slow + double damage shots)
- Tick (annoying with mines everywhere)

### Assassins / Ambushers
- Leon (great for sneaky kills)
- Crow (poison & slowing enemies)
- Fang (super can wipe multiple enemies)
- Edgar (jump onto weak enemies)

---

## Best Strategies for Wipeout:
| Strategy | Why it Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Stay Alive | Don't feed kills unnecessarily |
| Control the Map | Own the middle & bushes |
| Play as a Team | Focus fire makes quick kills |
| Use Bushes | Ambush and surprise enemies |
| Build Supers | Super abilities = easy kills |

---

## Map Style:
- Most Wipeout maps have:
  - A lot of open space (good for snipers)
  - Bushy sides (good for assassins)
  - Some maps have walls or obstacles to hide
  - Spawning is opposite sides (like Showdown)

---

## What Makes Wipeout Fun:
- Fast games.
- Comebacks happen a lot.
- 7-7 score → Last kill = Pure adrenaline!
- Super satisfying team wipes.

---

## Weak Brawlers in Wipeout (Usually):
- Tanks like El Primo, Bull → Hard to reach enemies without getting melted.
- Healers like Poco → No objective to heal around.
- Throwers like Barley → Map-dependent but often too easy to counter.

---

## Extra Pro Tips:
- Don't rush solo → Feeding = losing.
- Use your Super wisely → Don't waste on 1HP enemies.
- Map awareness is EVERYTHING → Know where everyone is.
- Stay spread out → Avoid getting hit by splash or supers.
- Low HP? Back off → Dying gives free kills to the enemy.

<h2>Hot Zone</h2>
<img src="https://tiermaker.com/images/templates/brawl-stars-hot-zone-maps-815887/8158871618995829.png" alt="">
Yess Hot Zone! 🔥 One of the coolest control-based modes in Brawl Stars! It's not about kills... it's about holding your ground like a boss!

---

## How Hot Zone Works:
- 3v3 mode.
- Stand inside the zone(s) to capture them.
- The longer you stay inside, the faster your team’s bar fills up.
- First team to fully capture the zone (or most % when time runs out) wins!
- There are usually:
  - 1 Big Zone → Center focused maps.
  - 2 Zones → Split map = control both or dominate one.

---

## Why Hot Zone is Special:
- It's all about *map control* not kills.
- Even if you lose fights → sneaky capture = huge value.
- Teamwork is super important → Can't just play solo.

---

## Best Brawlers for Hot Zone (Meta Picks)

### Control Masters
- Emz (absolute queen of Hot Zone with spray damage)
- Sandy (sandstorm for invisibility in the zone)
- Gale (push enemies out)
- Amber (flames cover huge area)

### Area Damage / Anti-Tank
- Spike (crazy area control)
- Lou (freezing zone is OP)
- Ash (rage bar charges quickly in zone)
- Bea (control + slowing enemies)

### Support / Healers
- Pam (heals + high zone presence)
- Byron (heals and damage)
- Poco (heals + pushes enemies back)

---

## Best Hot Zone Strategies:
| Strategy | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Control the Zone | Don't chase kills outside the zone. Focus inside! |
| Spam Supers in Zone | Big value because enemies are forced in. |
| Wall Breakers | Break walls if enemies hide behind them. |
| Slow/Push Abilities | Push enemies out of zone → Free time for your team. |
| Stay Spread | Avoid splash damage supers. |

---

## Hot Zone Map Styles:
- Some maps have 1 Zone in the middle → Big brawler fights.
- Some have 2 Zones → Forces split strategy or risky double team fights.
- Bushy maps → Great for sneaky brawlers.
- Open maps → Favor snipers & area control.

---

## Brawlers to Avoid (Usually in Hot Zone):
- Snipers like Piper or Brock (unless map is super open).
- Short range tanks like El Primo (unless bushy map).
- Throwers like Barley or Dynamike (map-dependent but can get rushed easily).

---

## Tips to Dominate Hot Zone:
- Don't leave the zone empty.
- Play for control, not kills.
- Use walls to hide & heal.
- Supers should control space, not just secure kills.
- Coordinate with teammates (like Sandy + Pam = crazy combo).

---

## Fun Facts:
- Emz & Pam = Most broken Hot Zone duo ever.
- Lou’s super → Literal freeze trap in the zone.
- Gale’s gadget → Pushes everyone OUT of the zone (so satisfying).
- Ash loves this mode because he charges rage bar fast.

<h2>Dules</h2>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSSoMQEkobnRRMLLvv-yvERL25LSozlvD3jYQ&s" alt="">
Ouu nice one! Duels Mode in Brawl Stars is super intense and all about 1v1 skill battles — kinda like a mini-tournament inside one match!

---

## How Duels Mode Works:
- 1v1v1 → But with *3 Brawlers* per player.
- No teammates → Pure solo action.
- Best of 3 → First player to eliminate all 3 enemy brawlers wins!
- If time runs out → There's a shrinking poison gas like Showdown to force fights.

---

## Rules of Duels:
1. You pick 3 Brawlers before the match starts.
2. The first brawler of each player starts fighting.
3. When you die → Your next brawler spawns.
4. Keep going until one player has no brawlers left.
5. It's not about kills... it's about winning the whole set.

---

## Why Duels is Unique:
- It's pure *skill testing*.
- No teammates to carry or save you.
- Picking the right 3 Brawlers is super important → Cover your weaknesses.
- Every matchup feels different.

---

## Best Types of Brawlers in Duels:

### First Pick (Safe & Versatile)

- Buster (tanky comeback king)
- Surge (if you got early upgrades)

---

## Best Duels Strategies:
| Strategy | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Balanced Trio | Pick long, mid, and close range brawlers. |
| Play Safe Early | Don't rush into damage. Scout first. |
| Win First Fight | Huge mental & tactical advantage. |
| Abuse Walls & Bushes | Sneak or control fights better. |
| Save Counters | Don’t waste anti-tank brawlers early. |

---

## Pro Tips for Duels:
- If you win the first fight → You’re in a huge lead.
- Don't let them heal for free → Keep poking.
- Watch enemy’s gadgets & supers → Predict next moves.
- Stay unpredictable → Change your playstyle every brawler.
- Your last brawler should be your comfort/power pick.

---

## Best Maps for:
- Snipers → Open maps.
- Tanks → Bushy, wall-heavy maps.
- Throwers → Some maze-like maps.

---

## Most Annoying Duels Combos:
- Bea → Fang → Edgar
- Piper → Buzz → Buster
- Gene → Ash → Surge
- Bonnie → Leon → Crow

---

## Fun Duels Fact:
- Players with strong *1v1 skill* shine here.
- Knowing Brawler matchups is everything.
- Some people pick their weakest brawler first just to scout your team.

<h2>Bounty</h2>
<img src="https://i.namu.wiki/i/r8yin47CQvQYfJ63qnn7lwMZ5_TNjNDTrGMk59fudjdedxboxaDcx3YignJ39CiS0N3VvrgzQ-yQBFljWl544A.webp" alt="">
Yoo Bounty Mode in Brawl Stars is a *classic* OG mode — it's all about getting kills but playing smart! Not just rushing in like crazy.

---

## How Bounty Works:
- 3v3 Mode.
- Every player starts with 2 stars over their head.
- Every time you kill an enemy → You gain their stars.
- The more kills a player gets without dying → The more stars they have (up to 7).
- The team with the most total stars when time runs out wins!

---

## Key Rule:  
→ Don't just get kills... *DON'T DIE* when you have lots of stars.

---

## Bounty Map Style:
- Usually long-range maps.
- Lots of walls or bushes for cover.
- Big open spaces for snipers to dominate.

---

## Best Brawlers for Bounty

### Sniper Gods
- Piper (absolute queen of Bounty)
- Brock (long-range with splash)
- Belle (damage multiplier is nasty here)
- Mandy (crazy sniper if aimed well)

---

### Support / Control
- Tick (annoying thrower, hard to approach)
- Gene (long-range pull is game-changing)
- Bo (bush control + mines)
- Nani (super can delete enemies holding many stars)

---

### Anti-Sniper / Assassins
- Leon (sneaky invisibility plays)
- Crow (poison prevents healing)
- Fang (map dependent rush plays)
- Mortis (high risk, high reward vs snipers)

---

## Best Bounty Strategies:
| Strategy | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Stay Alive | More stars = bigger target. Don't feed enemy stars. |
| Control Mid | Mid is king in Bounty. Hold it well. |
| Snipe Safely | Hit & run tactics are best. |
| Gadgets for Escape | Always save gadgets for survival, not just damage. |
| Bush Play | Hide → Surprise enemies → Escape. |

---

## Extra Tip: Blue Star Mechanic
- First kill of the match = Blue Star.
- If both teams have equal stars at the end → The team with Blue Star wins.
- So getting the *first kill* is very important!

---

## Annoying Bounty Combos:
- Piper + Tick + Gene → Death zone.
- Brock + Belle + Nani → Long-range nightmare.
- Leon + Crow + Bo → Bush ambush kings.

---

## Maps to Watch Out For:
- Open maps = Snipers dominate.
- Bushy maps = Assassins dominate.
- Wall-heavy maps = Throwers dominate.

---

## Final Bounty Tips:
- Don't overextend just for a kill.
- Stay with your team — avoid 1v3 situations.
- Protect your teammate with the most stars.
- Time-wasting at the end (if you're winning) is smart.
- Last second supers or pulls can flip the game.

<h2>Heist</h2>
<img src="https://i.namu.wiki/i/zWuNdqlu-mJbfJVSq2Ax7k7otPErPS3XNC9hBJHMLcVghH_8oTqGgoCFcADT3ULJFCQoqkV80H0tQry122rJQw.webp" alt="">
Heist Mode in Brawl Stars is all about *attacking* and *defending* — no kills needed to win — just DESTROY the enemy’s safe faster than they destroy yours!

---

## How Heist Works:
- 3v3 Game Mode.
- Each team has a *safe* with 100% health.
- Goal = Deal damage to enemy safe while defending your own.
- First team to destroy the enemy safe → Wins!
- If time runs out → Team that dealt the most damage wins.

---

## Key Rule:  
→ Damage to the safe is *everything*. Kills don’t matter unless they help damage the safe.

---

## Best Types of Brawlers for Heist:

### Heavy Safe Damage Dealers
- Colt (super melts safe)
- Bull (close-range tank shreds safe)
- Darryl (super rolls straight to safe)
- Rico (bounces shots off walls into safe)
- 8-Bit (damage boost with turret = safe deleting machine)

---

### Throwers (Safe Harassers)
- Barley (safe damage from behind walls)
- Dynamike (similar to Barley but riskier)
- Tick (less safe damage but strong defense)

---

### Tanks / Rushers
- El Primo (super jump straight to safe)
- Rosa (can tank while punching the safe)
- Buzz (gets on safe easily with stun)

---

### Control Brawlers (Defend & Push Forward)
- Jessie (turret can defend safe)
- Penny (her cannon forces enemies away)
- Bo (mines near safe area)

---

## Best Heist Strategies:

| Strategy | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Split Push | 1 or 2 players attack, 1 defends safe. |
| Double Rush | All 3 go for enemy safe super fast (risky but deadly). |
| Control Mid | Hold center → Easier to pressure enemy safe. |
| Use Gadgets on Safe | Some brawlers have gadgets that destroy safe quicker. |
| Sneaky Flanks | Darryl/Bull rolling from the side is brutal. |

---

## Best Maps for:
- Long Range → Colt, Rico, 8-Bit dominate open maps.
- Bushy Maps → Bull, Darryl, El Primo are beasts.
- Thrower Maps → Barley, Dynamike shine on wall-heavy maps.

---

## Top Meta Heist Comps:

### Classic Meta:
- Colt + Bull + Barley

### Aggressive Meta:
- Darryl + El Primo + Rico

### Control Meta:
- 8-Bit + Jessie + Penny

### Thrower Meta:
- Barley + Dynamike + Tick

---

## Heist Pro Tips:
- Don’t waste Super on enemies → Use it on the safe!
- Gadget damage on safe is OP (example: Colt’s silver bullet).
- Sneaking past enemies to hit safe can win games.
- Sometimes ignoring enemies and going for safe is better.
- Control mid → Best path to pressure enemy safe.
- Break walls near enemy safe with supers for easier damage.

---

## Fun Fact:
- Heist is one of the fastest Brawl Stars modes.
- Some matches last less than 1 minute if both teams rush hard.
- It’s the mode where DPS brawlers really shine.

<h1>Special Modes</h1>
<h2>Brawl Hockey</h2>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQBvydqV6SvatjnNVusa46FsTVF6POctmMraw&s" alt="">
Haha Taieb I see what you did there 😎 — you mean *Brawl Ball* aka *Brawl Hockey* (some players call it that for fun)!

Let me break it down for you:

---

## What is Brawl Ball (aka Brawl Hockey)?

→ It’s literally football/soccer (but with Brawlers).  
→ 3v3 Mode.  
→ First team to score *2 goals* wins!  
→ If the timer ends with 1-1 → Overtime starts (walls break).

---

## Main Rules:
- You can shoot or pass the ball.
- Super shots go faster & stronger.
- If you hold the ball → You can’t attack (but can Super).
